Campion became the third woman to win in this category at Golden Globes. Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy: “Hacks” HBO Max’s “Hacks” won the main Television (Musical or Comedy) category and Best Actress — Comedy/Musical for star Jean Smart at the 79th Golden Globes Awards. While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.", "On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams.

The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay.

Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers.

Swiatek’s surge to the top came at an opportune time. In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women’s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women’s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. “We’re trying to do our best to be good people,” she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.", "Year, Champion, Runner-up, Score. 2023, Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina (KAZ), 4-6 6-3 6-4. 2022, Ashleigh Barty (AUS), Danielle Collins (USA), 6-3 7-6(2).", "As the 2023 edition of the Australian Open heats up, fans and tennis lovers are starting to get a spring in their step as the air fills with excitement.

Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil.

For now, the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the 2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the international stage.

Heading into the Paris Masters, Djokovic had played just 10 events all season. He didn’t compete from mid-July to mid- September Since losing to Nadal in the quarterfinals of the French Open in June, Djokovic has won 17 of his last 18 matches, beating Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas in Astana, Kazakhstan, earlier this month. Still, he is ranked No. 7, his lowest ATP ranking since August 2018 when he was No. 10 following an extended break because of elbow surgery. So with the sport’s most dominant player faltering in the rankings, the year-end No. 1 ranking is up for grabs. Multiple players have more of the ATP points that determine the top spot than Djokovic, with Carlos Alcaraz, this year’s U.S. Open winner, sitting at No. 1, about 650 points ahead of second-ranked Nadal and about 3,800 ahead of Djokovic. “The rankings are really skewed this year,” said Pam Shriver, a former top-10 player and now an ESPN commentator. “A lot of people still look at Novak as No. 1.

The fallout from his accusations led Columbia to acknowledge that it had provided misleading data, and the school did not submit new data last year. Tuesday’s announcement makes that decision permanent. In making the announcement, Columbia applauded the recent move by U.S. News to focus on the success of colleges in graduating students from different backgrounds. But Columbia also suggested that it was concerned about the inclusion of data from students in its general studies program, who tend to follow nontraditional academic paths. Colorado College also withdrew from the rankings this year, along with Bard College, Rhode Island School of Design and Stillman College, a historically Black school in Alabama. L.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip.

On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time.

Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "LIVE   \t\t\t\tCommentary \t\t\t October 12, 2022  Economic Studies  This blog is a summary of an October 10, 2022 press conference with Dr. Ben Bernanke.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression.

Lee will portray Dr. Ben Seong, the “spiritual successor” of Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), the original time traveler on the series. Within the reboot/revival series, Seong is described as both “a world-renowned physicist” and also “a man of faith.” The potential show takes place 30 years after Sam disappeared into the time travel machine he created: the Quantum Leap accelerator. Seong will initially be a member of the new team, before eventually using the accelerator to go back to the past. According to to the report, ” Ben Seong gets stuck in the late 1980s with amnesia.” But there’s no mention about whether someone on his team can communicate with him in the form of a hologram, like the late Dean Stockwell’s Al. Lee’s previous credits include Scandal, Made of Love, Prodigal Son, Mozart in the Jungle, and Here and Now. He is also a series regular on AMC’s Kevin Can F*** Himself.

You can check out the trailer for Quantum Leap below. The problems are sure to start quickly, with the good doctor finding himself backstage and preparing to play a gig. Something he presumably has no idea how to do. While the trailer is rather brief, it gives us a good idea of the tone and aesthetics of the Quantum Leap revival, which will pick up 30 years after the original. Alongside the trailer, some promo art for the series has also been unveiled. Three decades after Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) first stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished, a new team, led by physicist Ben Song (Raymond Lee), has been assembled to restart the project in hope of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. Everything changes, however, when Ben makes an unauthorized leap into the past, leaving the team behind to solve the mystery of why he did it.

In his first speech as prime minister, Sunak promised \"integrity, professionalism and accountability,\" and said that \"we will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope.\"[115] Of his predecessor, Sunak said that Truss \"was not wrong\" to want to improve growth, but admitted that \"some mistakes were made\", and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to \"place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda\".[116]  Sunak began to appoint his cabinet on 25 October 2022.", "Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott             September 6, 2022 / 7:51 AM           / CBS News          London — Liz Truss officially became Britain's new prime minister on Tuesday after Boris Johnson formally resigned to Queen Elizabeth II at her home in Balmoral, Scotland, and the monarch accepted Truss as the new leader, inviting her to form a government. The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties. Johnson's three-year tenure was peppered with scandals, which eventually resulted in his ouster. So, who is the woman the Conservative Party has chosen to replace him? Like Johnson, 47-year-old Truss is a member of Britain's Conservative party. She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.  She takes over the premiership as the country faces that, and a number of other significant challenges, including sky-rocketing energy prices driven by the war in Ukraine.", "[172] She said she would cancel a planned rise in corporation tax and reverse the recent increase in National Insurance rates, funded by delaying the date by which the national debt is planned to fall, as part of a \"long-term plan to bring down the size of the state and the tax burden\".[173]  On 20 July, Truss and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak were chosen by Conservative Party MPs to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote. She finished second in the final MPs ballot, receiving 113 votes to Sunak's 137 votes.[174][175] In the membership vote, it was announced on 5 September that 57.4% of ballots were for Truss, making her the new leader.[175]  As the elected Leader of the Conservative Party, the majority party in the House of Commons, Truss was appointed the new prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle on 6 September 2022.[176]  Truss began appointing her cabinet and to other government positions on 6 September 2022.[177] With the appointment of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor of the Exchequer, James Cleverly as foreign secretary, and Suella Braverman as home secretary, for the first time in British political history, no white men held positions in the Great Offices of State.[178]", "Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott             Updated on:  October 25, 2022 / 7:49 AM           / CBS News          London — Rishi Sunak became prime minister of the United Kingdom on Tuesday after meeting with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace. The 42-year-old former treasury chief is the country's third premier in under two months, the youngest leader since 1812, and the first person of color to serve in the role. He is of Indian heritage and Hindu faith. \"Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin's war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains the world over,\" Sunak said in his first address as prime minister outside the PM's residence at Number 10 Downing Street. He paid tribute to his predecessor, Liz Truss, but said \"some mistakes were made,\" and that he had been chosen by lawmakers in his party, \"in part, to fix them.\" Sunak, who used to work in finance, is — alongside his wife, tech heiress Akshata Murty — one of the wealthiest people in the U.K. and served as treasury secretary under Boris Johnson.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month – almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.", "Jump to        With a vast library of TV shows, movies, and original programming, most people would agree that Netflix is an essential part of the entertainment landscape and easily one of the best streaming services you can sign up for. Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month.

The Standard plan costs $15.49 per month – $8.50 more than the cheapest plan currently available. There’s also the Premium plan, which costs $19.99 per month, pushing subscribers into a tier $13 more expensive than the cheapest one. Netflix’s Basic plan only allows streaming on a single device in 720p resolution. The Standard plan works with two devices simultaneously at 1080p resolution, while the Premium plan enables up to four devices simultaneously at 4K resolution. It’s uncertain at this point whether Netflix plans to discontinue the ad-free basic tier. When Netflix introduced its Basic plan with ads, the company also revealed that the new cheaper plan wouldn’t be available for Apple TV users. More than a month later, the situation is the same. Those who want to watch Netflix on Apple TV must subscribe to one of the more expensive plans without ads. The company never explained why the new ad-based plan is not available in Netflix’s tvOS app. But given the current situation in which Netflix may discontinue the Basic plan without ads, Apple TV users may be forced to subscribe to the more expensive plans if they still want to watch Netflix on the device.

Rubio was first elected in 2010, filling the seat of appointed Senator George LeMieux. The primary elections for Republicans and Democrats took place on August 23 to finalize candidates for the November election.[1][2] Rubio won the uncontested Republican primary, while incumbent U.S. Representative Val Demings won the Democratic nomination.

Still, Republicans remained close to winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives as officials continued counting ballots cast in Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections. Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. With Masto's victory on the heels of Democratic Senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, Democrats will control at least 50 Senate seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties in the 100-member chamber. \"America showed that we believe in our democracy, that the roots of democracy are deep and strong,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, told a news conference. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. The newly elected Senate will be sworn in on Jan. 3. Continued control of the Senate means Democrats will still be able to approve Biden's nominees such as federal judges.

(AP) — Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has won a third term, defeating U.S. Rep. Val Demings and holding a key seat as the GOP tried to regain control of a closely divided Senate. Rubio, 51, faced perhaps his toughest battle since he was first elected in 2010 after serving as the Florida House speaker. Once a presidential hopeful in 2016, Rubio’s name is less often mentioned as a potential 2024 candidate. WATCH LIVE: 2022 Midterm Elections | PBS NewsHour Special Coverage Rubio ran a campaign pulled from the Republican playbook, tying Demings to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden and hammering her on issues like spending, rising inflation and a crisis at the southern border. The Republican was helped by shifting voter registration numbers in Florida. The last time Rubio ran for reelection, Democrats had about 327,000 more registered voters than Republicans. That has since flipped, with the GOP now having a nearly 300,000 advantage over Democrats.", "That would give Democrats an additional edge in passing the few bills that are able to advance with a simple majority of votes, instead of the 60 needed for most legislation. It would also dilute the influence of Democratic Senators Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, \"swing\" votes who have blocked or delayed some of Biden's major initiatives, including expansions of some social programs. It could take several days or more before the outcome of enough House races are known to determine which party will hold the majority in the 435-seat chamber. Republicans continued to have an edge, but returns were still flowing in for several races, including many in liberal-leaning California. Biden, speaking in Cambodia, said his party would be focused on winning the Georgia Senate race but regarding the prospect of keeping control of the House he said: \"It's a stretch.\" House Republicans, should they prevail, have pledged to try to roll back Biden victories on battling climate change and want to make permanent a series of 2017 tax cuts that will expire. They also have planned investigations into Biden administration activities and probes of the president's son, who has had business dealings with Ukraine and China.

Naomi and Neal, who met through a mutual friend, announced their engagement in September 2021. In April, the lawyer tweeted that she would be celebrating her November nuptials at the historic Washington, DC, residence, and thanked her grandparents for the opportunity. “Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House,” she tweeted at the time. “We can’t wait to make our commitment to one another official and for what lies ahead.” Three months later, Naomi announced the location of her White House would be on the South Lawn, a decision that both the Secret Service and her pets were supportive of. “So not sure how best to update but was supposed to do so weeks ago… but we have finally figured out where the ceremony will be…and much to the relief of the Secret Service and with the dogs’ endorsement… we’ll be getting married on the South Lawn!” she tweeted, along with a photo of the sprawling White House lawn with the Washington Monument in the background. “Couldn’t be more excited.", "Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden‘s recent nuptials have gone down in history as the first wedding of a grandchild of a sitting US president at the White House.

The setting was the marble-floored Cross Hall, and Naomi, wearing pajamas and unsure how to work the White House speakers, played Elvis Costello’s “Still”’ on her iPhone as she and her fiancé improvised a casual waltz.  A few days later, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, November 19, the young couple, both lawyers—Naomi at the Washington, DC, firm Arnold & Porter, and Peter at the Georgetown Law Center on National Security—married on a crisp and cloudless day on the South Lawn in front of 250 family members and friends. “We’re so close to our families, so we always knew we’d get married in someone’s backyard,” explains Naomi."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

At varying points of the two games, fans of Spain and Japan as well as Costa Rica and Germany each thought that their countries might be on their way to the knockout phase.           Completely outplayed by Spain in the first half and trailing to Alvaro Morata’s first-half goal, somehow Japan stormed back to win 2-1 and top the group.           Japan’s two goals – from Ritsu Dōan and Ao Tanaka – came in the space of three minutes early in the second half.           Germany won 4-2 against Costa Rica, despite trailing at one point, but it wasn’t enough with Japan and Spain going through to the last 16.           Germany coach Hansi Flick said the “disappointment is huge” for Germany’s squad.            “In the first half I was disappointed and very angry at my team and how we allowed the opponent to come back,” Flick said, per Reuters.           “We wanted to score three or four goals in the first half but then we made mistakes.

Sandberg returns as a director, and Zachary Levi is back as the titular character. Asher Angel reprises the role of Billy Batson, a young fellow who can turn into a powerful, but still immature, superhero by saying the magic word Shazam! The original Shazam movie was released in April 2019. It received positive reviews for its lighthearted tone and sense of fun and was a box office success with $366 million worldwide against a $100 million budget. The sequel follows Billy and his siblings, collectively known as the Shazam family, on their next adventure as they face off against the Daughters of Atlas, who want to steal Billy and his siblings’ powers and threaten the world the meantime.

The following paragraphs contain spoilers for Shazam! Fury of the Gods. So, keep reading at your own risk.

Fury of the Gods” arrives with two strikes against it since it’s not only a studio-produced sequel but also a superhero movie made in 2023. One should expect a certain level of creative committee-mandated, Mad Libs-y monotony, regardless of how one feels about the surprisingly decent “Shazam!”. The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the landscape. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” meanders further in that direction. The first “Shazam!” works as well as it does because it’s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” mostly sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout.

Mirren is joining the Shazam! sequel as Hespera, the daughter of Atlas, according to The Hollywood Reporter and other sources.

Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, announced that it will debut an A.I.-powered, English-language chatbot called “Ernie Bot”—also ...", "On its surface, Bard looks a lot like ChatGPT, the AI bot from research lab OpenAI that went viral late last year and got a big update last week. Millions of people have tried that AI, and it has been integrated into Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Snapchat’s My AI virtual friend. ChatGPT is also notorious for sometimes going off the rails on weird tangents. Google brings several advantages to the AI race. It has spent years developing its underlying chatbot technology called LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. This is far-out stuff: Last year, Google fired an engineer for publicly claiming LaMDA was sentient. Google says no, its AI is actually just a “prediction engine,” or a very fancy version of auto-complete. It responds to a prompt by selecting, one word at a time, the words that are likely to come next. Google describes Bard as a “creative collaborator” that can help boost productivity and accelerate ideas. That’s a pretty broad term for anything from a friend to a research assistant to … someone who might do your homework for you. Leaning heavily into its “experiment” label, Google also says it’s trying to introduce Bard in a “responsible” way, which is one reason it is rolling out access slowly to people who sign up on its website. (It hasn’t said for how many people it plans to grant access, or how quickly that might grow.", "And it dovetails with Google’s index of all websites, so that it can instantly gain access to the latest information posted to the internet. This may make the chatbot more accurate in some cases, but not all. Even with access to the latest online information, it still misstates facts and generates misinformation. “L.L.M.s are tricky,” said Mr. Collins, Google’s vice president for research. “Bard is no exception.” Nico Grant is a technology reporter covering Google from San Francisco. Previously, he spent five years at Bloomberg News, where he focused on Google and cloud computing. More about Nico Grant Cade Metz is a technology reporter and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and The World.” He covers artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas.", "\"After the release of ChatGPT, only Baidu has made a benchmark product among the major tech companies in the world,\" it said. Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research, said while the event was clearly a disappointment for many who had viewed it as a trading catalyst, he still viewed Baidu as the best bet in China's AI space. \"We continue to advise investors to patiently hold BIDU shares as the best 'national champion' play in China’s (semi-segregated) AI space,\" he said. Baidu has touted its many years of heavy R&D investment in artificial intelligence and deep learning and said it plans to use Ernie Bot to revolutionise its search engine as well as use it to increase efficiency in cloud, smart cars and household appliances. Earlier this week, OpenAI on Tuesday said it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4, describing it as \"multimodel\", meaning images as well as text prompts can spur it to generate content. Li nodded to GPT-4 during his speech, saying it surprised him with its ability to summarise information, but cautioned against seeing this through the lens of geopolitics. \"Ernie Bot is not a tool of confrontation between China and the United States,\" he said. To date, 650 companies have said they will join the Ernie ecosystem, he added.

We’ve been working on an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard. And today, we’re taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. Use Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. We’re releasing it initially with our lightweight model version of LaMDA. This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback. We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.

With over 400 million monthly active users, Pinterest has built a healthy advertising business that generated strong cash flow and doubled revenue during the pandemic. In addition, Pinterest has been laser-focused on putting Pinners first, continuously improving its roadmap, investing in creators, shopping and scaling internationally.   “Building Pinterest with such a wildly talented, kind and creative team has been the gift of a lifetime,” said Silbermann. “Today, Pinterest inspires hundreds of millions of people with ideas for every aspect of their lives. We’ve built a growing global business that puts the well-being of our users at the core of everything we do. And we’re just getting started.”", "Musk, who completed a deal to buy Twitter last fall for $44 billion, will transition to executive chairman and chief technology officer of Twitter.  NBCUniversal also announced Yaccarino's departure from the company, effective immediately, on Friday. \"We are grateful for Linda Yaccarino's leadership of NBCUniversal's Advertising Sales business, and for the innovative team and platform she has built,\" Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said in a statement. \"Linda has made countless contributions to the company during her twelve year tenure, and we wish her the best.\" \"It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team. We've transformed our company and the entire industry—and I am so proud of what we've accomplished together, and grateful to my colleagues and mentors, especially Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and the entire NBCU leadership team,\" Yaccarino said. Yaccarino, a graduate of Penn State University, served as the chair of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal, acting as \"the strategic and operational bridge across the entirety of NBCUniversal's global networks, properties, and business units,\" according to her profile on LinkedIn. Her role involved monetizing the company's networks, digital and streaming platforms, distribution and commerce partnerships, and client relationships. That included overseeing all of its global, national and local ad sales.", "Pinterest CEO Bill Ready is upgrading the company’s business model in a difficult advertising landscape, and investors are taking notice. Analysts at Switzerland-based investment firm UBS published a report yesterday (March 26) highlighting the company’s improvements and crediting Ready. The stock rose 4 percent this morning as a result to $29.27 before falling slightly. “We think Bill Ready taking over as CEO has driven a philosophical shift in the company’s go-to-market (strategy) that will unlock faster top line growth,” UBS analysts Lloyd Walmsley, Chris Kuntarich and Rachel Freeman said in the report. Prior to Ready’s installation, the image-sharing social media platform, which went public in 2019, was spending more than it was making most years, according to company earnings reports. Pinterest earned its revenue by selling advertising space. In need of a new strategy, the board appointed Ready as CEO in June. He formerly worked as the president of commerce at Google and as the CEO of Venmo before that. He is expanding Pinterest’s advertising business by building new tools and partnering with advertising technology companies that can help target ads to the right users, and the investment world is applauding him. Pinterest’s competitors, as well as other media and tech companies, are fighting over a limited market for online advertising. As of January, Twitter’s daily revenue had reportedly dropped 40 percent from the year prior, according to the Information.", "New Pinterest (PINS) CEO Bill Ready is staying focused on the mission at hand despite a tough reaction by the market to fourth-quarter results and first-quarter guidance. \"Our mission is to go build a positive platform where users can find the inspiration to build a life they love, and we're seeing really great progress on that,\" Ready told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \"The best evidence of that is we grew engagement with users by double-digit percentage points, and we have returned to user growth.\" Ready, who took over as CEO in June 2022 after a career spanning the likes of PayPal and Google, stated he is focused on making Pinterest a more \"shoppable\" platform to drive sales — tapping into his experience in commerce at the aforementioned tech giants. Those efforts, coupled with fresh cost cuts, are expected to drive margin expansion this year for Pinterest in the face of a challenging ad sales market. Despite the progress on Pinterest's transformation, the stock fell 5% on Tuesday following a soft first-quarter outlook due to the economic-fueled ad market challenges tripping up social media players like Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), and Twitter. Here is how Pinterest performed compared to Wall Street estimates: 4Q22 Net Sales: $877.2 million vs. $887.2 million Adjusted EPS: $0.29 vs. $0.27 Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 450 million vs. 449.", "May 14, 2023 ...

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Sept 23 (Reuters) - Burberry (BRBY.L) finance chief Julie Brown will step down in April after more than five years in the role, the latest change of guard at the British luxury brand as it struggles to keep up with rivals. The 60-year-old British national, who joined the company in 2017 from medical products maker Smith & Nephew (SN.L), will also leave her role as chief operating officer and will take up an opportunity in a different industry, Burberry said on Friday. Brown's departure comes after former CEO Marco Gobbetti, the mastermind of a multi-year plan to reposition Burberry, jumped ship earlier this year after around five years in the role, and new boss Jonathan Akeroyd faces the challenge of steering the brand's sales to pre-pandemic levels. \"(Brown) has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth ...

More C-suite changes are expected: rumours have been circulating that Akeroyd is seeking a new chief creative officer to replace Riccardo Tisci, whose contract is due to expire in early 2023. Still, analysts were surprised by Brown’s exit. “While not an industry insider, Julie has definitely the merit of having promoted an unswerving focus on cost efficiency,” says Luca Solca, senior analyst at consultancy Bernstein, in a note. “This departure adds to the ‘to do’ list of Jonathan Akeroyd, as media reports indicate he is trying to recruit a new creative director as well. We think new and more original creative energy could benefit Burberry. The CFO departure at this point seems an outright setback, though.” Flavio Cereda, MD and analyst at financial services company Jeffries, writes: “No reasons have been disclosed for her decision to exit the group she joined six years ago, but it implies a further clean slate for new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd ahead of his strategic presentation (relaunch) in November.” “Julie has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth, supported by a high-quality team,” a statement from Akeroyd reads.

It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.  He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.", "We talked about these challenges, how he handled them, and what it means for toys and games to have such passionate fandoms. It’s really changed how Hasbro operates. We also talked about his decision to sell off part of Hasbro’s TV and film production company, eOne.

Oh, wow.  We’re talking to the executives of companies that are over 100 years old, and Hasbro just hit the mark this year. That’s pretty exciting. It has come a long way from where it started. I will tell you, I did not know that the name Hasbro is literally the Has brothers.  Hassenfeld brothers, yeah. It’s very good that they were like, “We’re bros,” in 1923. They were before their time.", "For the second time in six years, Hasbro has gone to the Microsoft well to find a new executive to run Wizards of the Coast.  Hasbro has hired Microsoft executive Cynthia Williams as President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, taking over when current WotC CEO Chris Cocks ascends to become CEO of Hasbro on February 25 (see \"Wizards of the Coast President To Run Hasbro\"), the company announced.  Cocks came to his Wizards of the Coast CEO role from Microsoft in 2016 (see \"WotC CEO Replaced by Microsoft Exec”).  Williams has been at Microsoft for about three-and-a-half years as General Manager & Vice President, most recently of the Gaming Ecosystem Commercial Team.  Prior to Microsoft, she spent 11 years at Amazon working on Fulfilled by Amazon, where she was the division’s first CFO and COO, finishing as General Manager and Vice President – FBA Business and Operations.  \"Cynthia brings a deep understanding of technology and e-commerce, along with cloud and console-based gaming,\" Cocks said of the incoming CEO.  \"She has a proven track record, across both Microsoft and Amazon, of scaling businesses to drive profitable growth.\"   Also joining the division’s management team is Tim Fields, who is coming in as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Digital Gaming."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new. But Google’s Magic Editor could make a more substantial form of fakery easier and more attractive.", "In its blog post explaining the tool, Google makes it seem like we’re all in search of perfection, noting that the Magic Editor will provide “more control over the final look and feel of your photo” while getting the chance to fix a missed opportunity that would make a photo look its best. Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I’m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn’t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe — just maybe — I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I’m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that’s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that’s something people should be obligated to disclose. Google calls its Magic Editor “experimental technology” that will become available to “select” Pixel phones later this year before rolling out to everyone else. If Google is already adding AI-powered image editing tools to Photos, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before smartphone makers integrate these one-tap tools, like sky replacement or the ability to move a subject, directly into a phone’s camera software.", "Mar 16, 2023  |  \tJared Spataro - CVP Modern Work & Business Applications  Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate.

You have successfully joined our subscriber list. iIn this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "The company is expected to host another product launch event next month, where it is expected to show off its newest iPads and computers, which could trigger some movement in the stock price again. But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality. Apple’s plans for the satellite service came with a plan to spend $450 million to support the feature, with Reuters reporting that a “majority” of that money is being funneled to Globalstar.", "But it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector. In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.", "The performance of the MATANA Group in a three-year period, from June 2020 to June 2023, has been remarkable. Nvidia led the way with an impressive 343% increase in its stock price, followed by Tesla with a 276% increase. Amazon has been the only company with negative figures over these 3 years, reflecting a -5% performance. However, it has shown slight signs of recovery from mid-2022 until June 29, 2023, achieving a gain of 12%. It is worth mentioning that the excessive surge in Nvidia’s stock price has been driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence industry. This has led the company to reach the milestone of one trillion dollars in market capitalization in early June 2023, becoming the seventh US company to achieve this feat, which is quite impressive for the renowned gaming GPU company. According to a report from Nasdaq, the best company in the MATANA group for long-term investment is Alphabet. In February 2023, Wall Street maintained a unanimous stance on buying Alphabet shares, with 32 analyst firms promoting its “purchase”. The analysts based their recommendations on Google’s market dominance in search (76% dominance compared to other search engines) since Google is owned by Alphabet. This could continue to strongly drive the company’s long-term growth through the advertising it offers.", "How many more subscriptions are you going to handle?\" he said. \"Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do IP licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.\" Wang stressed that Microsoft, which is often viewed as one of tech's leading legacy names, should be included in the group of tech's most elite leaders (and sometimes has been with the bulky FAAMNG acronym). \"Microsoft has more than just business-to-business and consumer – they've been able to manage both,\" he said. \"They're positioned well for the metaverse. They're positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they've got their gaming business.\" Rounding out the new grouping would be Tesla — a well-known success story at this point — and Nvidia. \"Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming,\" Wang said. \"They're sitting at the edge between AI, the metaverse, the future of computing, and the way they do their partnerships, they're set up in a way that's going to be dominant for quite some time.\" Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway “since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head.” They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple’s products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, “with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice.” That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that “given Apple’s size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions,” noting that the company has catalyzed China’s growth. “We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops.” Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.

That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "Apr 19, 2023 ...

Apple claims its Mumbai store is \"one of the most energy-efficient\" locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store's operations.

I really just had to do it on my own, and that was hard and I really paid the price at the end, and that was hard to swallow.” As the final event of the Games, Diggins, Brennan, Laukli, and McCabe had a ton of support not only from their cross country teammates but members of the U.S. Biathlon Team, and other Team USA athletes, coaches, and staff. “The cheering was insane,” Diggins said. “I felt like the whole world was cheering and helping me get up those hills.” With Johaug and Diggins off the front, the battle was on for the bronze.
