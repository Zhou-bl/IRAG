Campion became the third woman to win in this category at Golden Globes.

While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.", "On the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary — which boasted the most nominations of any show with five — built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams.

Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape.

The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.", "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year.

The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation.

The event usually hosts around 600 attendees, although a smaller number attended the 2021 Met Gala. Over the years, the Met Gala has delivered viral looks that are still being discussed today.

By Nico Grant Even Alphabet, the parent company of Google and one of the internet’s most entrenched businesses, was not immune to the punishing blows of the global economy and a sharp slowdown in the online advertising that is essential to the company’s profits. Alphabet on Tuesday reported a net profit of $13.9 billion in the third quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbed 6 percent to $69.1 billion. The earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion in profit on $71 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet. Since Alphabet last released financial results in July, the global economy has worsened, with rising inflation and interest rates as well as slowing growth prompting fears that even tech giants like Google’s parent, insulated by their popular products and piles of cash, would feel some financial pain. Those worries were realized in Tuesday’s results, which signaled that the online ad market was slowing as advertisers slashed budgets.

Kargman and Frank’s script moves briskly enough that there’s always something new to react to or think about. The production design and cinematography are slick — especially for a smaller movie — and the supporting cast boasts appearances by familiar, talented comedians like Ken Marino, Jim Gaffigan, Dolly Wells, and SNL’s Alex Moffat. But this is Clemons’ movie more than anyone else’s, and she delivers. Susie is always appealing, even when she’s making mistakes or dealing with the aftermath of those mistakes. As Susie’s mother has told her her whole life, she’s worth paying attention to, and so is this film. — Betsy Bozdech  Team #MOTW’s comments: Pam Grady: Shy, lifelong outcast Susie (Kiersey Clemons) has had a lifelong knack for solving mysteries, a talent she hopes will gain her followers for her true-crime podcast.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Sep 22, 2022 ...

Heading into the Paris Masters, Djokovic had played just 10 events all season. He didn’t compete from mid-July to mid- September Since losing to Nadal in the quarterfinals of the French Open in June, Djokovic has won 17 of his last 18 matches, beating Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas in Astana, Kazakhstan, earlier this month. Still, he is ranked No. 7, his lowest ATP ranking since August 2018 when he was No. 10 following an extended break because of elbow surgery. So with the sport’s most dominant player faltering in the rankings, the year-end No. 1 ranking is up for grabs. Multiple players have more of the ATP points that determine the top spot than Djokovic, with Carlos Alcaraz, this year’s U.S. Open winner, sitting at No. 1, about 650 points ahead of second-ranked Nadal and about 3,800 ahead of Djokovic. “The rankings are really skewed this year,” said Pam Shriver, a former top-10 player and now an ESPN commentator. “A lot of people still look at Novak as No. 1. After all, he’s only lost one match since June. His ranking may say No.", "7, but that’s all because of Wimbledon. He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.", "We use cookies to provide our services and for analytics and marketing.

At the age of 19 years and 214 days, US Open champion Alcaraz surpasses Lleyton Hewitt’s record of ending the year as world No. 1 aged 20 years and 275 days in 2001.            Alcaraz is missing this year’s ATP Finals in Turin, Italy as he continues his recovery from an abdominal injury sustained at the Paris Masters earlier this month, but compatriot Nadal’s early exit from the tournament means he still has cause to celebrate.           The teenager has enjoyed a sensational year, winning five ATP titles and becoming the youngest No. 1 in men’s tennis when he won his first grand slam title in New York.            Nadal could have leapfrogged Alcaraz at the top of the world rankings with victory in Turin this week, but after he lost 6-3 6-4 against Felix Auger-Aliassime on Tuesday and Casper Ruud won a set against Taylor Fritz, the 36-year-old bowed out of the tournament.

The fallout from his accusations led Columbia to acknowledge that it had provided misleading data, and the school did not submit new data last year. Tuesday’s announcement makes that decision permanent. In making the announcement, Columbia applauded the recent move by U.S. News to focus on the success of colleges in graduating students from different backgrounds. But Columbia also suggested that it was concerned about the inclusion of data from students in its general studies program, who tend to follow nontraditional academic paths.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.

Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired.

Later that month, Yamagami was sent to an Osaka detention center for a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which ended Tuesday. Yamagami is now back in police custody in Nara. Prosecutors said results of his mental evaluation showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told the Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami was in good health during his mental evaluation in Osaka when he was only allowed to see his sister and three lawyers.", "A person named Tetsuya Yamagami — the same name as the suspect — served in the Maritime Self-Defence Force from 2002 to 2005, a spokesman for Japan’s navy said, declining to say whether this was the suspected killer, as local media have reported. “During their service, members of the Self-Defence Force train with live ammunition once a year. They also do breakdowns and maintenance of guns,” a senior navy officer told Reuters. “But as they are following orders when they do it, it’s hard to believe they gain enough knowledge to be able to make guns,” he said. The shooter blamed the Unification Church for his mother’s financial problems, fuelling a grudge against Abe, whom he associated with the church, media said. Police have said only that Yamagami was angry at “an organisation.” The church has said Yamagami’s mother, who has not been publicly identified, is a church member. Abe, not a Unification Church member, appeared at an event hosted by an organisation affiliated with the group last year. photoGrid Photos from Abe’s funeral in Tokyo (top), mourners signing condolence books in the Japanese embassy in Bangkok, Thailand (bottom left) and a memorial wall outside of the de-facto Japanese embassy in Taipei, Taiwan (bottom right).

News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.            Later on Friday, Biden ordered American flags at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until Sunday in recognition of Abe’s death.

This post originally appeared on Chicago Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "LIVE   \t\t\t\tCommentary \t\t\t October 12, 2022  Economic Studies  This blog is a summary of an October 10, 2022 press conference with Dr. Ben Bernanke. Quotes have been edited slightly for clarity. You can listen to the full conversation here. Ben Bernanke, distinguished senior fellow in residence with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings, is among three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in economic sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression. Bernanke noted that looking back on the study, although it looked “a little primitive,” it had many fruitful ideas.", "Andrew Limbong                        Erneaux, photographed in 1984, is known for her works that deal with shame, sexism and class.

While filming has not yet begun, White has teased that he’s interested in exploring \"death and Eastern religion and spirituality.\" Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction. The first two seasons of The White Lotus are now available to stream on HBO Max. Liam Gaughan is a film and TV writer at Collider. He has been writing film reviews and news coverage for eight years with bylines at Dallas Observer, About.com, Taste of Cinema, Dallas Morning News, Schmoes Know, Rebel Scum, and Central Track. He aims to get his spec scripts produced and currently writes short films and stage plays. He lives in McKinney, TX.", "Explore the Sicilian hot-spots you can see all throughout the second season.  With HBO Max’s The White Lotus, you'll likely come for the paradisiacal backdrop and stay for the debauchery. But you may also want to stay at the show's scenic hot-spots for real—particularly the Italian coastal towns featured throughout its newly premiered Season 2.  The idyllic scenery is a character of its own in the popular anthology series, which follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus luxury hotel chain. The \"White Lotus\" property, in real life, is actually a Four Seasons resort, where Season 1 was exclusively shot in Maui, Hawaii. Now, for Season 2, the show introduces a brand new Four Seasons space that overlooks the Ionian Sea in a picturesque town located along the eastern coast of Sicily.  In this new season, the antics of the fresh new White Lotus guests and employees don't just stop at the hotel. With newly lifted COVID restrictions around filming, scenes venture beyond the confines of the resort and into the surrounding Sicilian area known for its aristocratic Baroque architecture—and it's upping the scales of opulence even further.

Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. With Masto's victory on the heels of Democratic Senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, Democrats will control at least 50 Senate seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties in the 100-member chamber. \"America showed that we believe in our democracy, that the roots of democracy are deep and strong,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, told a news conference. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. The newly elected Senate will be sworn in on Jan. 3. Continued control of the Senate means Democrats will still be able to approve Biden's nominees such as federal judges.

Marco Rubio has won a third term, defeating U.S. Rep. Val Demings and holding a key seat as the GOP tried to regain control of a closely divided Senate. Rubio, 51, faced perhaps his toughest battle since he was first elected in 2010 after serving as the Florida House speaker. Once a presidential hopeful in 2016, Rubio’s name is less often mentioned as a potential 2024 candidate. WATCH LIVE: 2022 Midterm Elections | PBS NewsHour Special Coverage Rubio ran a campaign pulled from the Republican playbook, tying Demings to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden and hammering her on issues like spending, rising inflation and a crisis at the southern border. The Republican was helped by shifting voter registration numbers in Florida. The last time Rubio ran for reelection, Democrats had about 327,000 more registered voters than Republicans. That has since flipped, with the GOP now having a nearly 300,000 advantage over Democrats.", "That would give Democrats an additional edge in passing the few bills that are able to advance with a simple majority of votes, instead of the 60 needed for most legislation. It would also dilute the influence of Democratic Senators Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, \"swing\" votes who have blocked or delayed some of Biden's major initiatives, including expansions of some social programs. It could take several days or more before the outcome of enough House races are known to determine which party will hold the majority in the 435-seat chamber. Republicans continued to have an edge, but returns were still flowing in for several races, including many in liberal-leaning California. Biden, speaking in Cambodia, said his party would be focused on winning the Georgia Senate race but regarding the prospect of keeping control of the House he said: \"It's a stretch.\" House Republicans, should they prevail, have pledged to try to roll back Biden victories on battling climate change and want to make permanent a series of 2017 tax cuts that will expire. They also have planned investigations into Biden administration activities and probes of the president's son, who has had business dealings with Ukraine and China.

Naomi’s now-husband also wore the designer, with the groom opting for a navy three-piece Ralph Lauren suit. Nearly two years ago, President Biden also wore a single-breasted navy suit by Ralph Lauren to his inauguration ceremony. Naomi and Neal, who met through a mutual friend, announced their engagement in September 2021. In April, the lawyer tweeted that she would be celebrating her November nuptials at the historic Washington, DC, residence, and thanked her grandparents for the opportunity. “Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House,” she tweeted at the time. “We can’t wait to make our commitment to one another official and for what lies ahead.” Three months later, Naomi announced the location of her White House would be on the South Lawn, a decision that both the Secret Service and her pets were supportive of. “So not sure how best to update but was supposed to do so weeks ago… but we have finally figured out where the ceremony will be…and much to the relief of the Secret Service and with the dogs’ endorsement… we’ll be getting married on the South Lawn!” she tweeted, along with a photo of the sprawling White House lawn with the Washington Monument in the background. “Couldn’t be more excited.", "“That was a big, big yes, because they’ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.”  When Biden and Moon visited O’Neill’s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. “[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.", "For the black-tie reception, Naomi changed into a strapless ivory silk Mikado Reem Acra dress, which had her grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls sewn into the six-foot train. It wasn’t the only special touch included in Naomi’s multiple wedding looks, as her Ralph Lauren gown also contained lace from Dr Jill Biden’s own wedding dress, which was stitched into the bodice. The president’s granddaughter then switched into a third dress, a beaded fringed Markarian mini-dress, for some late-night dancing, according to Vogue.  According to Noami, the wedding dress she wore to exchange vows with Neal was inspired by the high-necked gown famously worn by actress Grace Kelly when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. “Like every little girl, I had a vision in my head – it was Grace Kelly’s dress I loved,” she told Vogue. Meanwhile, Jill Biden, who is affectionately referred to as “Nana” by her grandchildren, wore a teal wool crepe coat and silk chiffon dress by Reem Acra for the wedding ceremony, followed by a gold embroidered, seafoam blue dress also by Acra for the reception. According to Vogue, the first lady beamed when she saw her granddaughter in her wedding dress for the first time. “Oh, honey!” she said, as she stretched out her arms for a hug.", "Nov 19, 2022 ...

The setting was the marble-floored Cross Hall, and Naomi, wearing pajamas and unsure how to work the White House speakers, played Elvis Costello’s “Still”’ on her iPhone as she and her fiancé improvised a casual waltz.  A few days later, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, November 19, the young couple, both lawyers—Naomi at the Washington, DC, firm Arnold & Porter, and Peter at the Georgetown Law Center on National Security—married on a crisp and cloudless day on the South Lawn in front of 250 family members and friends. “We’re so close to our families, so we always knew we’d get married in someone’s backyard,” explains Naomi."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

I think it’d have made more sense with someone younger at this point,” read another, while a third said: “that’s so sad that man is ancient.” Gosling responded to the criticism Wednesday in an interview with GQ magazine, saying: “If people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with.” He also joked that for decades nobody has ever particularly cared about Ken, who is really known only as Barbie’s boyfriend and the guy who works at the beach. “It is funny ...", "Dec 16, 2022 ...

Millions of people have tried that AI, and it has been integrated into Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Snapchat’s My AI virtual friend. ChatGPT is also notorious for sometimes going off the rails on weird tangents. Google brings several advantages to the AI race. It has spent years developing its underlying chatbot technology called LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. This is far-out stuff: Last year, Google fired an engineer for publicly claiming LaMDA was sentient. Google says no, its AI is actually just a “prediction engine,” or a very fancy version of auto-complete. It responds to a prompt by selecting, one word at a time, the words that are likely to come next. Google describes Bard as a “creative collaborator” that can help boost productivity and accelerate ideas. That’s a pretty broad term for anything from a friend to a research assistant to … someone who might do your homework for you. Leaning heavily into its “experiment” label, Google also says it’s trying to introduce Bard in a “responsible” way, which is one reason it is rolling out access slowly to people who sign up on its website.

A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces.

We’ve been working on an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard. And today, we’re taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. Use Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. We’re releasing it initially with our lightweight model version of LaMDA. This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback. We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information. We’re excited for this phase of testing to help us continue to learn and improve Bard’s quality and speed."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

In fact, I had predicted that Team Blake’s “pure country” contestant, a 22-year-old Georgia crooner by the extremely Opry-marquee-worthy name Bryce Leatherwood, would take the Season 22 title. (I must also gloatingly point out that I predicted the finale’s entire leaderboard, from fifth through first place, but I’ll get to those results in a bit.) What did make Tuesday’s finale surprising and historic, however, was the fact that Bryce was the first Instant Save contestant to ever win The Voice. And Bryce was actually saved more than once this season: first during the Battle Rounds, by his coach, and then during the top 16 results show's Instant Save sing-off, as a viewer-voted wild card. However, Bryce peaked at just the right time this week, with Monday’s razzle-dazzling, personality-plus cover of Elvis Presley’s “T-R-O-U-B-L-E,” and by the end of that top five performance night, Blake’s wife and fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, was predicting that Bryce would win.", "Gina Miles was named as the winner of the season, with the closest margin to-date, on the season finale that aired on May 23, 2023.", "GoldDerby The all-important live shows for “The Voice” Season 23 are scheduled to begin a little later than usual this year, on May 15, 2023.

Following the performance, Miles had her pick between Horan and Kelly Clarkson. Horan noted that he could sense Miles was nervous, but that he could also tell she has a lot of character in her voice — something he said was particularly impressive considering Miles is just 18. “You’re gonna grow into this competition,” he told the singer from Illinois. “I feel like you’ve got so much more to give. This is very exciting. Well done.” Although Clarkson said she was “a really big fan” of Miles’ voice and could help the singer improve her vocal techniques, Miles ultimately opted to join Horan’s team, where she stayed for the entire competition.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Sept 23 (Reuters) - Burberry (BRBY.L) finance chief Julie Brown will step down in April after more than five years in the role, the latest change of guard at the British luxury brand as it struggles to keep up with rivals. The 60-year-old British national, who joined the company in 2017 from medical products maker Smith & Nephew (SN.L), will also leave her role as chief operating officer and will take up an opportunity in a different industry, Burberry said on Friday. Brown's departure comes after former CEO Marco Gobbetti, the mastermind of a multi-year plan to reposition Burberry, jumped ship earlier this year after around five years in the role, and new boss Jonathan Akeroyd faces the challenge of steering the brand's sales to pre-pandemic levels. \"(Brown) has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth ... I look forward to building on the strong foundations we have in place to realise Burberry's full potential,\" Akeroyd said in a statement.", "By Sarah Shannon and Kati Chitrakorn The news, which sent Burberry’s share price down nearly 4 per cent in morning trading, comes six months after the arrival of new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd. More C-suite changes are expected: rumours have been circulating that Akeroyd is seeking a new chief creative officer to replace Riccardo Tisci, whose contract is due to expire in early 2023. Still, analysts were surprised by Brown’s exit. “While not an industry insider, Julie has definitely the merit of having promoted an unswerving focus on cost efficiency,” says Luca Solca, senior analyst at consultancy Bernstein, in a note. “This departure adds to the ‘to do’ list of Jonathan Akeroyd, as media reports indicate he is trying to recruit a new creative director as well. We think new and more original creative energy could benefit Burberry. The CFO departure at this point seems an outright setback, though.” Flavio Cereda, MD and analyst at financial services company Jeffries, writes: “No reasons have been disclosed for her decision to exit the group she joined six years ago, but it implies a further clean slate for new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd ahead of his strategic presentation (relaunch) in November.” “Julie has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth, supported by a high-quality team,” a statement from Akeroyd reads.

For the final episode in our Centennial Series covering companies that are 100 years old, I’m talking to Chris Cocks, the CEO of Hasbro. And I have to tell you, I did not know the company was started in 1923 by the Hassenfeld brothers… the Has bros. This is my favorite fact now.  Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.  He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.", "We talked about these challenges, how he handled them, and what it means for toys and games to have such passionate fandoms. It’s really changed how Hasbro operates. We also talked about his decision to sell off part of Hasbro’s TV and film production company, eOne.  Chris is a lifelong gamer — you’ll hear him talk about that history several times. And he’s keenly aware that toys and games have become a market for adults as much as for kids. This is really a remarkable conversation: toys are a big, complex business.  Okay, Chris Cocks, CEO of Hasbro. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Chris Cocks, you are the CEO of Hasbro. Welcome to Decoder. Nilay, thank you so much for having me. I’m really excited to talk to you. You’re the final episode in our Centennial Series. Oh, wow.  We’re talking to the executives of companies that are over 100 years old, and Hasbro just hit the mark this year. That’s pretty exciting. It has come a long way from where it started. I will tell you, I did not know that the name Hasbro is literally the Has brothers.  Hassenfeld brothers, yeah. It’s very good that they were like, “We’re bros,” in 1923. They were before their time.", "Chris’s extensive omni-channel experience and proven track record make him the ideal leader for Hasbro as it continues to become the world’s leading play and entertainment company. On behalf of the Board, we thank Rich for serving as Interim CEO during a difficult time for the Hasbro family and are delighted he will serve as Chair of our Board.”   Mr. Stoddart said: “Having known Chris for years and working more closely with him these last several months, I have no doubt that he will be an extraordinary leader for the next phase of Hasbro’s journey. A storyteller and gamer at heart, Chris innately understands how to create and nurture brands to drive fan and consumer connection across channels. He is a highly strategic leader, with the vision, skills and experience to unlock our Brand Blueprint for supercharged growth.”   Mr. Cocks said: “Hasbro has amazing brands, gifted storytellers and unique entertainment assets, and I am humbled to step into the position of CEO at this important time and to build on the strong foundation Brian created. Our consumer products, gaming and entertainment teams are the best and most creative in the business and have shown such incredible resilience.

Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new. But Google’s Magic Editor could make a more substantial form of fakery easier and more attractive.", "In its blog post explaining the tool, Google makes it seem like we’re all in search of perfection, noting that the Magic Editor will provide “more control over the final look and feel of your photo” while getting the chance to fix a missed opportunity that would make a photo look its best. Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I’m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn’t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe — just maybe — I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I’m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that’s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that’s something people should be obligated to disclose. Google calls its Magic Editor “experimental technology” that will become available to “select” Pixel phones later this year before rolling out to everyone else. If Google is already adding AI-powered image editing tools to Photos, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before smartphone makers integrate these one-tap tools, like sky replacement or the ability to move a subject, directly into a phone’s camera software.", "Mar 16, 2023  |  \tJared Spataro - CVP Modern Work & Business Applications  Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate.

The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy.

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor.

Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine. Barry has a remarkable combination of chemical insight, uncanny intuition and real-world practicality—he is a chemist’s chemist and a wonderful colleague.” “Click chemistry”—a term Sharpless coined—is a set of methods for constructing chemical compounds via irreversible, highly efficient reactions between smaller molecules.

You have successfully joined our subscriber list. iIn this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "The company is expected to host another product launch event next month, where it is expected to show off its newest iPads and computers, which could trigger some movement in the stock price again. But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality. Apple’s plans for the satellite service came with a plan to spend $450 million to support the feature, with Reuters reporting that a “majority” of that money is being funneled to Globalstar.", "But it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector. In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.", "The performance of the MATANA Group in a three-year period, from June 2020 to June 2023, has been remarkable. Nvidia led the way with an impressive 343% increase in its stock price, followed by Tesla with a 276% increase. Amazon has been the only company with negative figures over these 3 years, reflecting a -5% performance. However, it has shown slight signs of recovery from mid-2022 until June 29, 2023, achieving a gain of 12%. It is worth mentioning that the excessive surge in Nvidia’s stock price has been driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence industry. This has led the company to reach the milestone of one trillion dollars in market capitalization in early June 2023, becoming the seventh US company to achieve this feat, which is quite impressive for the renowned gaming GPU company. According to a report from Nasdaq, the best company in the MATANA group for long-term investment is Alphabet. In February 2023, Wall Street maintained a unanimous stance on buying Alphabet shares, with 32 analyst firms promoting its “purchase”. The analysts based their recommendations on Google’s market dominance in search (76% dominance compared to other search engines) since Google is owned by Alphabet. This could continue to strongly drive the company’s long-term growth through the advertising it offers.", "How many more subscriptions are you going to handle?\" he said. \"Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do IP licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.\" Wang stressed that Microsoft, which is often viewed as one of tech's leading legacy names, should be included in the group of tech's most elite leaders (and sometimes has been with the bulky FAAMNG acronym). \"Microsoft has more than just business-to-business and consumer – they've been able to manage both,\" he said. \"They're positioned well for the metaverse. They're positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they've got their gaming business.\" Rounding out the new grouping would be Tesla — a well-known success story at this point — and Nvidia. \"Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming,\" Wang said. \"They're sitting at the edge between AI, the metaverse, the future of computing, and the way they do their partnerships, they're set up in a way that's going to be dominant for quite some time.\" Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway “since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head.” They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple’s products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, “with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice.” That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that “given Apple’s size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions,” noting that the company has catalyzed China’s growth. “We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops.” Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers. During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city’s “incredible energy, creativity, and passion.", "The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "A few days after that, he is set to unlock the doors on the New Delhi store, in a high-end mall in the Saket neighborhood. That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "Apr 19, 2023 ... Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall. The Apple brand is not new to ...", "Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company's biggest markets. Apple claims its Mumbai store is \"one of the most energy-efficient\" locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store's operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said. Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple's future and in February he said he was \"bullish\" on the world's fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a \"significant amount of energy\" into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO. India's smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India. But India is undergoing a \"premiumification of market,\" according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah.

I put everything I have into the snow today and finished with nothing left.\" In the individual sprint free earlier in the Games, Diggins took bronze behind Swedish pair Jonna Sundling and Maja Dahlqvist. After that race, she said, \"I'm so grateful because this medal really belongs to the whole team. And it really means so much because it takes so much from so many people. \"I'm so happy and so grateful, really, to be here. It's been a lot of pressure and a lot of stress this year and a lot of Covid this year. And so to be here I think that makes it extra special, because it was so hard.\" After her debut at Sochi 2014, this is Diggins' second consecutive Games where she has made the top-10 in every event she has competed in. Seeing athletes perform well at the highest level can prove pivotal in growing sports that aren't in the mainstream, and Diggins hopes that will be the case in the United States. When asked about attracting prospective cross-country skiers, she said: \"It's so important.", "With wind gusts in excess of 50mph and temperatures in the low teens, Johaug threw down an attack on the second lap, grinding her nose into the wind and building a lead of 27 seconds over Diggins at the halfway point. Meanwhile, Diggins clawed out a 49-second advantage over Sweden’s Ebba Andersson in third, while Brennan led the charge in the chase group. “I felt really good, but it was a frustrating race,” Brennan said. “I really wanted to bridge up that top group, but nobody was really interested in working with me, which is always hard. I really just had to do it on my own, and that was hard and I really paid the price at the end, and that was hard to swallow.” As the final event of the Games, Diggins, Brennan, Laukli, and McCabe had a ton of support not only from their cross country teammates but members of the U.S. Biathlon Team, and other Team USA athletes, coaches, and staff. “The cheering was insane,” Diggins said. “I felt like the whole world was cheering and helping me get up those hills.” With Johaug and Diggins off the front, the battle was on for the bronze. Andersson was eventually caught by the chase group, finishing eighth, while Brennan just missed a medal by  5.4 seconds.", "In the final sprint, Diggins passed the last two individual sprint classical gold medalists – Sochi gold medalist Maiken Caspersen Falla of Norway before the last turn and then Pyeongchang gold medalist Stina Nilsson of Sweden on the last straightaway.
